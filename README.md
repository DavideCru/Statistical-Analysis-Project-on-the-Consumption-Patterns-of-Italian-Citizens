# Statistical Analysis Project on the Consumption Patterns of Italian Citizens

Project Type: University Statistical Analysis Project<br>
Tools Used: R (lm, glm, kmeans, corrplot, ROC analysis)

This project analyzes the consumption behavior of Italian citizens using advanced statistical modeling techniques in R. The objective was to identify the main socio-economic determinants influencing household consumption and to explore patterns in economic behavior across regions and employment conditions. <br>

🔎 Methodology<br>
The analysis combines multiple quantitative approaches:<br>
- Simple Linear Regression to evaluate the relationship between net available income and consumption.<br>
- Multiple Linear Regression to assess the joint impact of income, household size, employment status, geographic region, transportation expenses, and number of income earners.<br>
- Logistic Regression to model the probability of long-term unemployment experience (>6 months).<br>
- K-means Clustering to identify homogeneous economic behavior groups.<br>
- Boxplot Analysis to compare regional consumption distributions (North, Center, South).<br>

📈 Key Findings<br>
- Net available income is the strongest predictor of consumption (R² ≈ 0.56 in simple regression; R² ≈ 0.65 in multiple regression).<br>
- Household size and transportation expenses positively influence consumption.<br>
- Geographic region and employment status show statistically significant differences.<br>
- Logistic regression shows moderate discriminative ability (AUC ≈ 0.65) in predicting long-term unemployment experience.<br>
- Clustering reveals three distinct economic profiles: low-income/low-consumption, middle-income/moderate-consumption, and high-income/high-consumption groups.<br>
- Southern Italy shows generally lower consumption levels compared to North and Center regions.<br>
